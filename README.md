# My College Projects
Projects done during college.

The repo contains the following projects:
* Compilers:
  * Dominator - Generating dominators for nodes of random graph using Lengauer-Tarjan algorithm.
  * SSA - SSA code generation.
  * Betaparse and TAC - Projects to generate three address code for a subset of 'C' using lex-yacc.
  * HandwrittenLexerParser - 'C' implementation to generate ASTs for a subset of 'C'.
  * MRIS - Final year project. A kind of instruction scheduling to reduce the number of registers used during register allocation.

* dsAlgo: Few Data Structures and Alogrithm Implementations:
  * B+ Tree - Insert and search operations.
  * Red-Black Tree - Insert, Delete and search operations.
  * Sorting algorithms and comparision - bubble, selection, heap, quick.
  * treap - A combination of tree and heap.
  * xsort - A kind of bubble sort.

* PHP-SQL based projects:
  * sqleasy - A simple project to generate random tuples for a given schema. Simplifies database learning by reducing the overhead of creating tuples.
  * Query Processor - A web interface for `sqleasy' project.
  * Student Alumni database

* Others
  * Telephone billing software - Only SRS, SDS and tests.
  * Compression and Decompression - Minimum Variance Huffman Coding implementation.
